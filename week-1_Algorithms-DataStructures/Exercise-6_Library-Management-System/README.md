# Library Management System
 ## Scenario
      You are developing a library management system where users can search for books by title or author.
## Understand Search Algorithms
  ### Linear Search
     Description: Scans each element in the list one by one until a match is found.
     
     Time Complexity:
              Worst case: O(n)
              Best case: O(1)
  ### Binary Search
    Description: Efficient algorithm that repeatedly divides the sorted list in half to locate a value.
    
    Condition: The list must be sorted.
    
    Time Complexity:
             Worst case: O(log n)
             Best case: O(1)

## Analysis
            Algorithm	          Time Complexity	          When to Use
           Linear Search	           O(n)                 	Small, unsorted datasets or rare searches
           Binary Search	           O(log n)	           Large, sorted datasets with frequent search operations

## How to Run

      1. Open Terminal or Command Prompt in the project directory.
      2. Compile all Java files:
               javac *.java
      3. Run the Main class:
              java Main
