# Score Calculator App

   The **Score Calculator App** is a beginner-friendly React application designed to demonstrate the creation and usage of functional components, props, and simple    CSS styling. It calculates the average score of a student based on their name, school, total score, and academic goal.

   This app provides a clean and minimal user interface where users can input student details and view the calculated score on the screen. It is a great learning      project for anyone getting started with React.
